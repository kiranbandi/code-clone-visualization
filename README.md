# COGVIS - A CODE CLONE GENEALOGY VISUALISATION TOOL

Code clone genealogies describe the evolution of clones in a software system across several versions and play a key role in the process of software maintenance.However, understanding the textual results of genealogy extractors without the aid of a proper visualization tool can be challenging. In this paper, we present a web tool that can visualize code clone genealogies in the form of a circos style circular plot and a standard scatter plot. Our tool generates the visualizations from the output files generated by gCad a clone genealogy extractor. The goal of our tool is to provide an effective visualization, for analyzing the evolutionary nature of code clones over the various releases of the subject software system,  and to provide an overall representation of the changes that occur in the code clone fragments.

The tool is available [here](https://kiranbandi.github.io/code-clone-visualization/)

### To have the project running locally ,run the following commands  -

* `npm install`
* `npm run start`

The first command installs the node dependencies while the second one starts the webpack development server
#### If the local server runs successfully the application should be live [here](http://localhost:8080)


### Future Work

* Support for outputs of other genealogy extractors.
* Available as a standalone destop application (Electron Packaging)
* Improvements to detailed description section with fragments shown via graphics instead of simple text
