# COGVIS - A CODE CLONE GENEALOGY VISUALISATION TOOL

Code clone genealogies show the evolution of code clone classes of a software system that span multiple versions. Understanding the textual results of genealogy extractors without the aid of proper visualization tool is challenging. To mitigate this problem, we present a web tool that provides visualization for the genealogies of the clone classes in the form of a circos style circular plot and a standard scatter plot. Our tool generates the visualizations from the output files generated by gCad. The goal of our tool is to provide an effective visualization for the evolutionary nature of the code clone classes for the various releases or versions of the subject software system to provide an overall representaion of the changes that occur during the life of the system.

The tool is available [here](https://kiranbandi.github.io/code-clone-visualization/)

### To have the project running locally ,run the following commands  -

* `npm install`
* `npm run start`

The first command installs the node dependencies while the second one starts the webpack development server
#### If the local server runs successfully the application should be live [here](http://localhost:8080)


### Work in Progress 

* Support to upload clone files 
* Improvements to detailed description section with fragments shown via graphics instead of simple text
